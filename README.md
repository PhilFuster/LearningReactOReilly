# Philip Fuster's run through of Learning React: Modern Patterns for Developing React Apps
## By: Alex Banks & Eve Porcello
I was watching a lot of tutorials on React but I was not enjoying that learning style.
Working with Learning React has been a great experience so far. I enjoy taking it at my pace.
This book is well written and you can tell the authors know exactly what they are doing.
I have confidence in what I am learning and am having fun in the process.
I am beyond excited to work through this book.
